# NFL_Offensive_Line_Analysis
The NFL_cap dataset includes the wins, vegas_win_total, and the percentages of spending by position for each nfl team from 2021-2016.

Both of these hypothesis turned out to be false. However, it was still an interesting look at how teams choose to spend their money positionally.
